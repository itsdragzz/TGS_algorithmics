    "At Trinity, we are organizing a one week camping excursion for year 10 students. The camping site has tents with capacity for 5 persons, so it is time to decide who is going to share a tent with who. Previous years, when deciding who was going to share a tent with who we had some students feeling left out. To prevent conflicts between students, this year we decided to hand in a form to each student where they had to rate from 1 to 10 how happy they would be sharing a tent with each of their class mates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have all the students preferences and we want the students as happy as possible with their tentmates. However, it is way too much information, the teachers are going crazy trying to make the perfect matches, so they decided to delegate the problem to the students of algorithmic thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to design an algorithm that generates groups of 5 people among the students. This algorithm should:\n",
    "* Assign every student to a tent\n",
    "* Not put a student in more than one tent \n",
    "* Maximize the happiness of the students with their tentmates\n",
    "* Be as efficient as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, you will be given a csv file with a table similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Students**          | Jonathan Spence | Shannon Rasmussen | Nicholas Shaw | Michael Lyons |\n",
    "|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Jonathan Spence**   |        0        |         5         |       8       |       10      |\n",
    "| **Shannon Rasmussen** |        8        |         0         |       6       |       2       |\n",
    "| **Nicholas Shaw**     |        10       |         6         |       0       |       7       |\n",
    "| **Michael Lyons**     |        10       |         6         |       9       |       0       |\n",
    "\n",
    "Wehre, in the first row and the first column you have the name of all the students participating in the camping. On each row you have the information about the rating a specific student has given to its classmates. Thus, for example Jonathan Spence and Michael Lyons both have rated each other with a 10 and thus would be ideal for them to be in the same tent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate your algorithm, there is a **Happyness Score (HS)** that can take values from 0 to 10, based on the average happyness in each tent. This score will be 10 if all the students in every tent have rated their tentmates with a 10. Your goal is to have the highest possible HS. The HS will be 0 if there is at least one student that has not been assigned to any tent, if at least one student that has been assigned to more than one tent or if the algorithm takes more than 1 minute to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your algorithm will also be evaluated on its efficiency with an **Efficiency Score (ES)**, based on the time it takes your algorithm to run, where the maximum running time is 60 seconds, which would receive an ES=0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your **Final Score (FS)** will be the weighted mean between the HS and ES:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "FS = 0.7·HS + 0.3·ES\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit a solution you will have to create a file named \"happy_camping_challenge.py\" which contains a function with the following structure:"
